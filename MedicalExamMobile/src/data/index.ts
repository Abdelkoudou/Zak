      question: "A 65-year-old patient presents with irregular heart rhythm. ECG shows absence of P waves and irregularly irregular RR intervals. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      answers: [
        { id: "a", text: "Atrial fibrillation", isCorrect: true },
        { id: "b", text: "Atrial flutter", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "c", text: "Ventricular tachycardia", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "d", text: "Sinus arrhythmia", isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: "Atrial fibrillation is characterized by the absence of P waves and irregularly irregular RR intervals on ECG. The atrial activity appears as fibrillatory waves, and the ventricular response is irregular due to random conduction through the AV node.",
      difficulty: "Intermediate",
      topic: "Arrhythmias",
      reference: "Braunwald's Heart Disease, 12th Edition",
    },
    {
      id: "2",
      question: "Which medication is considered first-line treatment for rate control in atrial fibrillation?",
      answers: [
        { id: "a", text: "Amiodarone", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "b", text: "Metoprolol", isCorrect: true },
        { id: "c", text: "Digoxin", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "d", text: "Flecainide", isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: "Beta-blockers like metoprolol are first-line agents for rate control in atrial fibrillation. They effectively slow the ventricular response by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors at the AV node, reducing conduction velocity.",
      difficulty: "Intermediate",
      topic: "Arrhythmias",
      reference: "AHA/ACC/HRS Guidelines for Atrial Fibrillation",
    },
    {
      id: "3",
      question: "A patient with atrial fibrillation has a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3. What is the recommended anticoagulation strategy?",
      answers: [
        { id: "a", text: "No anticoagulation needed", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "b", text: "Aspirin therapy", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "c", text: "Oral anticoagulation with warfarin or DOAC", isCorrect: true },
        { id: "d", text: "Dual antiplatelet therapy", isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: "A CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3 indicates high stroke risk, requiring oral anticoagulation. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin are recommended for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and elevated stroke risk.",
      difficulty: "Advanced",
      topic: "Arrhythmias",
      reference: "ESC Guidelines for Atrial Fibrillation",
    },

  "cardiology-heart-failure": [
    {
      id: "4",
      question: "Which of the following is the most common cause of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)?",
      answers: [
        { id: "a", text: "Hypertension", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "b", text: "Coronary artery disease", isCorrect: true },
        { id: "c", text: "Valvular disease", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "d", text: "Cardiomyopathy", isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: "Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), accounting for approximately 60-70% of cases. Ischemic cardiomyopathy results from myocardial infarction and chronic ischemia.",
      difficulty: "Intermediate",
      topic: "Heart Failure",
      reference: "ACC/AHA Heart Failure Guidelines",
    },
  ],
  "neurology-stroke": [
    {
      id: "5",
      question: "What is the therapeutic window for intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke?",
      answers: [
        { id: "a", text: "3 hours from symptom onset", isCorrect: false },
        { id: "b", text: "4.5 hours from symptom onset", isCorrect: true },

        { id: "d", text: "8 hours from symptom onset", isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: "The therapeutic window for intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke is 4.5 hours from symptom onset, as established by multiple clinical trials including ECASS III. Treatment within this window significantly improves functional outcomes.",
      difficulty: "Intermediate",
      topic: "Stroke",
